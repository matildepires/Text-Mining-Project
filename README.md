# Text Mining Project

**Project Description:**
This project consists of a simulated version of the WMT Metrics Shared Task, in which we created a metric that correlates with human assessments of quality. The corpus is composed by six different language pairs, as seen in the report and contains, among others, the source sentence to be translated, the reference translation made by a human being, the translation made by a machine and the z-score representing the quality of the machine translation.
The main goal was to use existing Machine Translation (MT) metrics and to create customized models, using Python, in order to predict scores that correlate well with the existing quality assessments given by annotators and present in the corpus, according to Pearson’s and Kendall’s Tau correlation coefficients.
