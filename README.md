# Text Mining Project

**Project Description:**
This project consists of a simulated version of the WMT Metrics Shared Task, in which we created a metric that correlates with human assessments of quality. The corpus is composed by the following language pairs: Russian to English (ru-en), German to English (de-en), Czech to English (cs-en), Chinese to English (zh-en), English to Chinese (en-zh) and English to Finish (en-fi).
Our main goal was to use existing Machine Translation (MT) metrics and to create our own models, using Python, in order to predict scores that correlate well with the existing quality assessments in the corpus, according to Pearson’s and Kendall’s Tau correlation coefficients.
